# Nev

This is a presentation of some features of Nev.

You can see which keys are pressed in status bar in the bottom right of the window.












































## Vim motions

Nev supports some Vim motions (mainly the ones I use).

This is an example sentence for demonstration.
This is an another example sentence for demonstration.












































## Multiple cursors

Nev supports multiple cursors.

This is an example sentence for demonstration.
This is an another example sentence for demonstration.

Use `L` in normal or visual mode to add another cursor at the next instance of the selected text.
Use `C-h` and `C-f` to add cursors above or below.









































## Quick jump

Pressing `S-m` in normal mode will enter a quick jump mode where random letters are placed at the beginning of words.
Typing those letters will move the cursor to that word.

## Word highlight

Nev highlights all occurrens of the word under the cursor, or the selected text if the selection is not empty.
This allows you to quickly see instances of a variable, or check if two pieces of text are the same by simply selecting
the first instance.

let foo = 1
let bar = 2
let baz = foo + bar

































## Regex search

You can open the search bar by typing `/`. Matching text is highlighted as you type in the search bar.

    This is some demo text.
    Here is a foo. Here is a bar.
    Here is another foo, bar, baz and yet another foo.

Hit `ENTER` to confirm the search and `ESCAPE` to cancel (reverting back to the previous search results).

    This is some demo text.
    Here is a foo. Here is a bar.
    Here is another foo, bar, baz and yet another foo.

To clear search results simply type `/` followed by `ENTER` (in other words search for an empty search string).

    This is some demo text.
    Here is a foo. Here is a bar.
    Here is another foo, bar, baz and yet another foo.































## Modify numbers

You can use `gxh` and `gxf` to decrement/increment the number under the cursor.

You can use `gxc` to add `n` to the `nth` cursor (so add 0 to the first cursor, 1 to the second etc).

var a1 = 1
var a2 = 1
var a3 = 1
var a4 = 1
var a5 = 1
var a6 = 1
var a7 = 1
var a8 = 1
var a9 = 1
var a10 = 1
var a11 = 1

































## Color highlights

Nev can detect colors and add colored inlay hints. This has to be configured per language.
For this example the configuration is:

  "lang.markdown.text.color-highlight": {
      "enable": true,
      "regex": "#([0-9a-fA-F]{6})",
      "kind": "hex",
  }

  #FF0000
  #00FF00
  #0000FF
  #00FFFF
  #FF00FF
  #FFFF00
  #000000
  #777777
  #FFFFFF






























## Command line

Nev has a command line to run any builtin or plugin provided command.
To open the command line press `:` like in vim.

Use `C-n` and `C-p` to show/navigate the completion list and `C-y` to apply the selected completion.
Use `UP` and `DOWN` to navigate the command history.
The completion list also show history entries.










































## Vim motions in command line

The command line is a regular text editor like the one we're in right now.
It starts in `insert` mode by default, but you can just press `ESCAPE` to go to normal mode.

To close the command line without running anything hit `ESCAPE` in normal mode (so twice when you're in insert mode)

Let's copy and paste this command into the command line by pressing `ESCAPE` and then `p` in the command line:

  choose-theme

more.
